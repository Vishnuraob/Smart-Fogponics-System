Smart Fogponics System 
Overview
The Smart Fogponics System is an automated plant cultivation system that uses nutrient-rich fog instead of soil or traditional hydroponics. This project integrates embedded systems, sensors, and control logic to create an efficient, water-saving, and scalable solution for modern agriculture.
The system continuously monitors environmental parameters and controls fog generation, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth with minimal human intervention.



Key Features
•	Soil-less cultivation using fog-based nutrient delivery
•	Real-time monitoring of environmental parameters
•	Automated control of fogger and actuators
•	Water- and energy-efficient farming solution
•	Suitable for controlled indoor agriculture and research



System Architecture
The system follows a closed-loop control approach:
1.	Sensors collect environmental data
2.	Microcontroller processes the data
3.	Actuators are controlled based on predefined thresholds
4.	Continuous feedback ensures stable plant growth conditions

Hardware Components
•	Microcontroller (ESP32 / Arduino / equivalent)
•	Ultrasonic fogger (mist generator)
•	Temperature and humidity sensor
•	Water level sensor
•	Relay module
•	Power supply
•	Fogponics chamber


Software Stack
•	Embedded C / Arduino framework
•	Sensor interfacing and data acquisition
•	Control logic for fogger and actuators
•	Optional serial or cloud-based monitoring


Working Principle
•	The fogger atomizes nutrient solution into fine mist
•	Plant roots absorb nutrients directly from the fog
•	Sensors monitor temperature and humidity
•	Fogging is automatically enabled or disabled based on sensor readings
•	Ensures faster growth and reduced water consumption


Advantages
•	Uses significantly less water than soil-based farming
•	Faster nutrient absorption
•	Reduced risk of soil-borne diseases
•	Compact and scalable design
•	Suitable for smart agriculture and IoT integration



Applications
•	Smart agriculture
•	Urban and indoor farming
•	Research and academic projects
•	Sustainable food production systems



Future Enhancements
•	Cloud-based data logging and analytics
•	Mobile or web dashboard
•	pH and EC monitoring
•	AI-based growth optimization
•	Solar-powered operation


How to Run the Project
1.	Assemble the hardware as per the circuit design
2.	Upload the firmware to the microcontroller
3.	Power the system
4.	Observe sensor readings and fogger operation
5.	Fine-tune threshold values if required

Completed prototype with successful testing under controlled conditions.
